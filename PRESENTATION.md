The enigma machine was a machine used by Nazi Germany to encode and decode private messages before and during World War II.
The machine was "enigmatic" because of its thousands of configurations through different rotors and their combinations, in addition to the many plugboard configurations. When typing into the machine, a letter would pop up after a letter is typed, displaying the encrypted/decrypted message.
