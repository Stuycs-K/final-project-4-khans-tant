The enigma machine was a machine used by Nazi Germany to encode and decode private messages before and during World War II.
The machine was "enigmatic" because of its thousands of configurations through different rotors and their combinations, in addition to the many plugboard configurations. When typing into the machine, a letter would pop up after a letter is typed, displaying the encrypted/decrypted message.

The Enigma Machine consisted of several components:

- Keyboard: The machine had a typewriter-like keyboard, which was used to input the plaintext message.

- Rotors: The heart of the Enigma Machine was a set of rotating wheels or rotors. These rotors contained a series of electrical contacts and could be set in different positions. Each rotor had 26 contact points, corresponding to the letters of the alphabet. When a key was pressed on the keyboard, an electrical signal was sent through the rotors.

- Reflecting Mechanism: After passing through the rotors, the electrical signal was redirected by a reflecting mechanism. This mechanism caused the signal to bounce back through the rotors in a different path, adding an extra layer of complexity to the encryption process.

- Lampboard: The output of the Enigma Machine was displayed on a lampboard, which had a row of lights representing the encrypted letters. When a key was pressed, the corresponding encrypted letter would light up on the lampboard.

The encryption process involved three main steps:

- Key Setting: Before encryption could begin, the Enigma Machine had to be set up with specific configurations. This involved choosing the initial position of the rotors, selecting which rotors to use, and determining the starting position of each rotor.

- Encryption: When a key was pressed on the keyboard, an electrical signal was generated. This signal entered the Enigma Machine and passed through the rotors, which would scramble the signal by swapping the electrical pathways. As the signal passed through each rotor, its position would change, resulting in a different encrypted letter being displayed on the lampboard.

- Decryption: To decrypt the message, the recipient would need to have an Enigma Machine set up with the same key settings as the sender. They would input the encrypted message using the keyboard, and the machine would display the decrypted letter on the lampboard.

The strength of the Enigma Machine's encryption relied on several factors, including the number of rotors, the different positions of the rotors, the reflecting mechanism, and the daily-changing key settings. These factors made it extremely difficult for the Allies to decipher the encrypted messages.

However, with remarkable effort and the genius of codebreakers like Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park, the Enigma Machine's encryption was eventually cracked, providing the Allies with valuable intelligence that contributed significantly to the outcome of World War II.
